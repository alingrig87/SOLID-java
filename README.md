# SOLID Principles

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility. This principle encourages a class to encapsulate only one aspect of functionality.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle suggests that new functionality should be added through the creation of new code entities rather than modifying existing ones.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a derived class should be able to substitute its base class without causing errors.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle encourages the creation of specific interfaces for clients, preventing them from being forced to depend on interfaces they do not need.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple high-level and low-level components, allowing for more flexibility and easier maintenance.
