# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Overview

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a fundamental principle in object-oriented design. It advocates that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. By adhering to SRP, we aim to create more focused, maintainable, and readable code.

## Principle Explanation

### What is SRP?

SRP encourages the design of classes that encapsulate only one aspect of functionality. When a class has a single responsibility, it becomes more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs.

### Why is SRP Important?

1. **Modularity**: Each class focuses on a specific responsibility, promoting modular design.
2. **Maintainability**: Classes with a single responsibility are easier to maintain and update.
3. **Readability**: Code becomes more readable as each class has a clear and well-defined purpose.
