# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

## Overview

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a fundamental principle in object-oriented design. It states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By adhering to OCP, we aim to create systems that are flexible and easily extensible without modifying existing code.

## Principle Explanation

### What is OCP?

OCP suggests that software entities, such as classes, modules, and functions, should be designed in a way that allows new functionality to be added through the creation of new code entities, rather than modifying existing ones.

### Why is OCP Important?

1. **Flexibility**: The system is open for extension, allowing for the addition of new features without altering existing code.
2. **Maintainability**: Existing code remains untouched, reducing the risk of introducing bugs in previously working functionality.
3. **Scalability**: Easier integration of new features without the need for widespread code changes.
